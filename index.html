        <p>

            Badminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles),
            who
            take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. Players score points by
            striking a shuttlecock with their racket so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half
            of
            the court. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the ground, and the shuttlecock may only be struck
            once
            by each side before it passes over the net.
        </p>
        <p>

            The shuttlecock (or shuttle) is a feathered projectile whose unique aerodynamic properties cause it to fly
            differently from the balls used in most racket sports; in particular, the feathers create much higher drag,
            causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly than a ball. Shuttlecocks have a much higher top speed,
            when
            compared to other racket sports. As the shuttlecock flight is stubbornly affected by wind, competitive
            badminton
            is always played indoors. Badminton is also played outdoors as a casual recreational activity, often as a
            garden
            or beach game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 1992, badminton has been an Olympic sport with five events: men's and women's singles, men's and
            women's
            doubles, and mixed doubles, in which each pair is a man and a woman. At high levels of play, the sport
            demands
            excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a
            technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racket movements.
